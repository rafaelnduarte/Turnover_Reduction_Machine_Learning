# Turnover_Reduction_Machine_Learning

As the volume of data created daily increases, it's vital for companies to know how to collect and use their data, in a way that can bring them competitive advantages.

There are many ways companies can benefit from Data Science. [Recommendation Systems]('https://towardsdatascience.com/recommender-systems-in-practice-cef9033bb23a'), for example, can be very useful. but even in e-commerce, it's important to understand and take care of your employees.

> With that in mind, the goal of this project is to analyze the data available and look for ways to **Reduce Employee Turnover**, increasing retention of good professionals.

Using data collected from [Kaggle]('https://kaggle.com/'), we'll build a Machine Learning model that's capable of predicting attrition among employees, which can help companies take prevention actions to minimize attrition effects, increase employee quality of life, and retain the best professionals of the company.
